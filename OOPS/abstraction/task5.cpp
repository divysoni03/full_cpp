// 5. Restaurant Rating System:
//    - Problem: Build a system to rate and review restaurants based on the quality of their dishes.
//    - Test Case: Ensure that each restaurant can be rated based on the taste and presentation of its dishes.
//    - Logic: Define an abstract class 'Restaurant' with methods to calculate average ratings. Subclasses like 'ItalianRestaurant', 'ChineseRestaurant', etc., implement rating calculation logic based on customer reviews.
