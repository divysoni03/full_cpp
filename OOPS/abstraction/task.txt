Using Abstract Class:

1. Cuisine Management System:
   - Problem: Design a system to manage different cuisines offered by a restaurant.
   - Test Case: Ensure that each cuisine can calculate the total cost of its dishes.
   - Logic: Create an abstract class 'Cuisine' with methods for adding dishes and calculating total cost. Subclasses like 'ItalianCuisine', 'ChineseCuisine', etc., implement specific dish addition and cost calculation logic.

2. Recipe Book Application:
   - Problem: Develop an application to store and manage recipes from various cuisines.
   - Test Case: Verify that a recipe can be categorized into a specific cuisine.
   - Logic: Define an abstract class 'Recipe' with methods to display ingredients and cooking instructions. Subclasses like 'ItalianRecipe', 'ChineseRecipe', etc., implement cuisine-specific details.

3. Online Food Ordering System:
   - Problem: Create a system for customers to order food online from multiple restaurants.
   - Test Case: Ensure that the total cost of an order includes taxes and delivery charges.
   - Logic: Define an abstract class 'FoodItem' with methods to calculate the price including taxes. Subclasses like 'Pizza', 'Sushi', etc., implement specific price calculation logic and apply taxes accordingly.

4. Diet Planner Application:
   - Problem: Develop an application to help users plan their diet by selecting meals from different cuisines.
   - Test Case: Verify that the total calorie count of a selected meal plan is accurate.
   - Logic: Create an abstract class 'Meal' with methods to calculate total calories. Subclasses like 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', etc., implement calorie calculation logic based on the chosen cuisine.

5. Restaurant Rating System:
   - Problem: Build a system to rate and review restaurants based on the quality of their dishes.
   - Test Case: Ensure that each restaurant can be rated based on the taste and presentation of its dishes.
   - Logic: Define an abstract class 'Restaurant' with methods to calculate average ratings. Subclasses like 'ItalianRestaurant', 'ChineseRestaurant', etc., implement rating calculation logic based on customer reviews.
