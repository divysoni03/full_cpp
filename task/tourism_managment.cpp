// -> Tourism Destination Management System
// You need to develop a Tourism Destination Management System to manage the destinations available in a travel agency's offerings. The system should support the following operations:

// 1. Create: Add a new destination with the attributes DestinationID, name, and description.
// 2. Read: List all the destinations available in the system.
// 3. Update: Update the details (name and description) of an existing destination based on its DestinationID.
// 4. Delete: Remove a destination from the system based on its DestinationID.

// Use switch case where it is possible.
